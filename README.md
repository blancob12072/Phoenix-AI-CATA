Phoenix AI CATA (Circuit and Thermal Analysis)
Developed by Phoenix Poly Design

🛠️ Professional Engineering Intelligence
Phoenix AI CATA is a professional-grade serverless suite designed for deep-level circuit auditing and thermal simulation. Built by an electronics technician with 25+ years of hands-on experience, this tool bridges the gap between theoretical AI and practical, bench-side reality.

🚀 Performance & Scale
This suite is optimized for high-tier hardware to ensure precision and reliability:

VRAM Target: 48GB+ (Optimized for NVIDIA A6000, A40, and 6000 Ada).

Disk Space: 50GB Container Disk for large-scale engineering datasets.

Features: Automated Netlist Auditing, Thermal Hotspot Prediction, and Failure Mode Analysis.

📋 Usage Example
Send a JSON payload to the endpoint with your circuit netlist:

JSON

{
  "input": {
    "analysis_type": "thermal_audit",
    "netlist": "R1 N001 N002 1k; V1 N001 0 12V",
    "ambient_temp": "25C"
  }
}
💎 Why Choose Phoenix AI CATA?
Unlike generic models, this suite understands the nuances of PCB design, component tolerances, and thermal dissipation constraints. It is designed to provide actionable technical reports, not just text.
